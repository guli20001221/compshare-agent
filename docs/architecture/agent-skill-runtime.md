# Agent Runtime Terms

This document defines the runtime terms used by the Youyun CompShare console
agent. Its purpose is to keep the current primitives — the central Agent loop,
typed read capabilities, the action resolver, sealed workflows, typed
observations, the response gateway, RAG-as-a-tool, guardrails, and MCP —
separate in both code and review language.

## Terms

### Tool

A tool is a typed callable action. It has a name, input schema, policy level, and
execution result. Console API wrappers (instance description, pricing, stock,
image listing) and the mutating API calls are tools; `SearchKnowledge` is the
read-only knowledge-retrieval tool.

Tools are not playbooks. The central Agent or a deterministic workflow may call
them, but the tool definition itself is not a set of instructions to read.

### Central Agent

The central Agent is the single reasoning point (`internal/engine/`). It runs one
ReAct-style loop over a compiled `AgentContext`: each round it selects a read
capability, calls a knowledge tool, or proposes a write, and observes the typed
result in the same loop. There is no separate router and no per-request choice
between three execution forms.

### Read Capability

A read capability is a typed, model-visible read vertical
(`internal/capability/read_*.go`). Each owns its request struct, its **field
contract** (`field_contract.go`'s `schemaNode` — the single source for the tool
schema, runtime validation, and the consistency test), its handler, and its
renderer. `ReadDefinitions()` is the catalog; the engine dispatches through
`executeConcreteReadCapability` → `capability.RegisteredReadForTool(action)` →
`RegisteredRead.Run`. There is no route registry.

### Action Resolver

The action resolver (`internal/actionresolver/`) deterministically resolves the
target instance and spec of a proposed write (e.g. whether an image catalog must
be re-queried, via `SpecNeedsImageCatalog`). A write target is authorized only
when the user's reply deterministically resolves to it — the model does not
"interpret a candidate list" in place of deterministic target selection.

### Sealed Workflow

A sealed workflow (`internal/workflow/`) is a deterministic write process with
confirmation. It has a fixed step sequence, code-enforced safety checks, and no
free-form mutating tool calls by the model. Deployment, disk changes, lifecycle
ops (start/stop/reboot/reset-password/rename) and custom image creation are
sealed workflows. The `SealedActionContract` separates the confirmed action from
runtime metadata, and volatile fields (e.g. image) are re-confirmed before
execution.

Mutation stays behind workflow code and confirmation gates; a read capability or
`SearchKnowledge` may help explain or diagnose, but never mutates.

### Typed Observation

A tool result is not free text. A read capability returns a
`ReadCapabilityObservation` carrying status and a structured evidence envelope.
The Agent reasons over those facts and authors the final Markdown itself. The
ordinary read renderer's text is not a user-visible block and is never appended
to the Agent response a second time.

### Response Gateway

The response gateway (`engine`'s `finalizeResponse`) does not substitute or
append ordinary read results. It enforces the never-0% monitor invariant
(all-no-data historical monitor → whole-answer "cannot confirm", never
0%/healthy) and is the narrow server-side delivery path for credentials that
must not enter model context.

Note: ordinary read fidelity is intentionally delegated to the Agent, grounded
in the envelope facts; it is not a verbatim-insertion contract. The configured-
model monitor acceptance checks the reply against those facts without prescribing
the reply's wording or layout.

### RAG Evidence

RAG is retrieval used **inside** the Agent loop, via the `SearchKnowledge` tool —
not a terminal answer form. The Agent chooses when to search and supplies the
user-facing retrieval intent. On the turn's first knowledge search,
`planKnowledgeQuery` produces 1–3 contextualized retrieval queries and resolves
references when history exists; planning failure or an empty plan falls back to
the Agent-supplied query unchanged. Production retrieval goes to
the configured CompShare KB MCP endpoint; local retrieval code is retained for
tests and offline evaluation. The result contains cited chunks the Agent grounds
its answer in. Citation discipline is **fail-open**:
if the Agent cannot cite, the original answer ships with citation markers stripped
— citation formatting never regenerates user-facing prose. The only hard stop is
a raw-evidence leak (security). Citation-marker leakage into the final text is
caught by the output guard.

### Diagnosis Chain

A diagnosis chain (`internal/diagnosis/`) is a read-only diagnostic tool.
`DiagnoseBilling` is the only advertised one; `chainRegistry` equals the
advertised set, so an unadvertised diagnosis name cannot resolve (model-invisible
≠ unreachable). The SSH chain still exists and still runs, but not as a
`DiagnoseSSH` tool — `internal/capability/read_instance_access.go` constructs it
directly, so SSH reaches the model as `ReadCapability_instance_access`. That
precheck is explicitly cloud-side: it verifies the exact instance, lifecycle
state, structured login endpoint, and monitor risk signals, but does not probe a
public port or inspect the guest OS. Symptoms without a dedicated chain
(GPU/init/port/image) are handled by the central Agent gathering evidence via
`SearchKnowledge` + `DescribeCompShareInstance`.

### Conversation History and Execution State

The ordered conversation and canonical tool transcript are the model's semantic
history. Persisted session state holds only execution continuity (selection
provenance, pending selection, form/confirmation state) plus verifier-only
evidence; it does not preserve a second summary of decisions or tool facts.
Current-state verification remains mandatory before a write.

### Guardrail

A guardrail is a code-enforced safety rule: destructive-action blocks, mutating
confirmation, tool policy checks, provenance gates, citation validation and
output redaction. It protects an execution or data boundary; it does not classify
the user's topic before the Agent. Model-generated risk assessments are
observability signals, not the source of truth for write safety.

### MCP Client

MCP is a transport protocol, not another Agent layer. This service is an MCP
client only for the configured CompShare knowledge endpoint. It does not expose a
general MCP tool server or dynamically import arbitrary remote tools.

## Runtime Shape

```text
user request
  -> central Agent loop (engine): each round selects one of
       read capability  |  SearchKnowledge  |  propose write -> resolver -> sealed workflow
  -> response gateway (safety invariants / sensitive credential delivery)
  -> output guard (sanitizer / policy)
```

There is exactly one execution shape — the central Agent loop. Reads, knowledge
retrieval, and writes are choices *within* the loop, not separate top-level
pipelines.

## Naming Rules

- Use `central Agent` for the single engine loop; do not say "router" or "tier".
- Use `read capability` for a typed model-visible read vertical.
- Use `action resolver` for deterministic write-target/spec resolution.
- Use `sealed workflow` for deterministic mutating flows with confirmation.
- Use `typed observation` / `response gateway` for the result → render path.
- Use `RAG evidence` for retrieval consumed inside the loop (`SearchKnowledge`).
- Use `tool` for typed callable actions.
- Use `MCP server` / `MCP client` by direction; do not call MCP an agent layer.
